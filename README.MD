# Question text
Consider a string expression consisting of the characters `<` and `>` only. We consider the string 
to be *balanced* if each `<` always appears *before* (i.e., to the left of) a corresponding `>` 
character (they do not need to be adjacent). Moreover, each `<` and `>` act as a unique pair of 
symbols and neither symbol can be considered as part of any other pair of symbols. For example, the 
strings `<<>>`, `<>`, and `<><>` are all *balanced*, but the strings `>>`, `<<>`, and `><><` are 
*unbalanced*.

To balance a string, we can replace **only** `>` character with `<>` at most `maxReplacement` times. 
Given an `expression` and the value of `maxReplacement`, can you turn an unbalanced string into a 
balanced one?

Complete the `balancedOrNot` function in the editor below. It has the following parameters:

1. An array of `n` strings, `expressions`, denoting the list of expressions to check.
2. An array of `n` integers, `maxReplacements`, where `maxReplacements[i]` denotes the maximum 
number of replacements allowed when attempting to balance `expressions[i]`.

The function must return an array of integers where each index `i (0 ≤ i < n)` contains a `1` if 
`expressions[i]` is balanced or a `0` if it is not.

## Input Format:
A set of internal unit tests will be on the code with input in the following format.

The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the size of `expressions`.

Each line `i` of the `n` subsequent lines (where `0 ≤ i < n`) contains a string describing 
`expressions[i]`.

The next line contains an integer, `m`, denoting the size of `maxReplacements`.

Each line `i` of the `n` subsequent lines (where `0 ≤ i < n`) contains a string describing 
`maxReplacements[i]`.

## Constraints
* 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^2
* 1 ≤ length(expressions[i]) ≤ 10^5
* 0 ≤ maxReplacements[i] ≤ 10^5

## Output Format:
The function must return an array of integers where each index `i (0 ≤ i < n)` contains a `1` if 
`expressions[i]` is balanced or a `0` if it is not.

## Observations:
* Check that your code runs before submitting it!

## Sample Input (0):
```
2
<>>>
<>>>>
2
2
2
```

## Sample Output (0):
```
1
0
```

## Explanation (0):
We process `expressions = ["<>>>", "<>>>>"]` and `maxReplacements = [2, 2]` like so:

1. For string `<>>>` with `maxReplacements[0] = 2`, it becomes balanced after two replacements: 
`<>>>` → `<><>>` → `<><><>`. Because the string was converted in ≤ `maxReplacements[0]` 
replacements, we store a `1` in index `0` of our return array.
2. For string `<>>>>` with `maxReplacements[1] = 2`, becomes balanced after three replacements: 
`<>>>>` → `<><>>>` → `<><><>>` → `<><><><>`. Because the string was converted in > 
`maxReplacements[1]` replacements, we store a `0` in index `1` of our return array.
We then return the array `[1, 0]` as our answer.

## Sample Input (1):
```
2
<>
<>><
2
1
0
```

## Sample Output (1):
```
1
0
```

## Explanation (1):
We process `expressions = ["<>", "<>><"]` and `maxReplacements = [1, 0]` like so:

1. For string `<>` with `maxReplacements[0] = 1`, it is already balanced and needs no replacements. 
Because the string is balanced in ≤ `maxReplacements[0]` replacements, we store a `1` in index `0` 
of our return array.
2. For string `<>><` with `maxReplacements[1] = 0`, the string is not balanced. It's impossible to 
balance the string because it ends in < (and we're also restricted to performing `0` replacements), 
so we store a `0` in index `1` of our return array. We then return the array `[1, 0]` as our answer.
